This folder contains source code of I4.0-ready asset layer.

This layer includes four assets, i.e., three robot system and one turntable system. The reason why we said 'I4.0 ready' is because each asset was equipped with an 'I4.0 adaptor', which is an OPC UA server collecting field data from assets in a uniformed manner.

The detailed control process for example for kuka robot was shown in the following figure.

With regard to I4.0-ready asset layer, hardware includes TSN talker, TSN listener, kuka controller, and kuka manipulator. (TSN control for robot will be introduced in other GitHub repository.)

The control process for other two Epson robots are similar with that of the kuka robot.
